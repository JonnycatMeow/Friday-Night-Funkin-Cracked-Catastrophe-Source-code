IF YOU GOT THIS MOD FROM ANYWHERE OTHER THAN https://mega.nz/folder/vJYBAKwJ#AldzxBG_XKh5uAz7Dx9LpA PLEASE READ THIS FILE IN IT'S ENTIRETY. YOUR IP COULD POTENTIALLY BE AT RISK.

A section of this mod connects to the internet in order to retrieve the current day. This is done for completely non-malicious reasons and is on a non-malicious site, which you can verify by reading RaidState.hx and looking for the line 
[var request = new haxe.Http("https://www.timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=UTC");]

Furthermore, in order to protect your privacy against potential bad actors, the mod's checksum will be freely available in a .txt in the official MEGA download. I would highly recommend you check the mod against the provided checksum in order to assure that you're not downloading a modified version with an IP grabber or some shit like that.


"I'M CRASHING ON OVERFLOW!!!!!!"

So you can't even support a few shaders? No worries, I've got you covered. Hit SHIFT on the title screen and it should bring you straight to the settings. Fix your shit in preferences, exit out of settings and restart the mod. You should be fine from there.

"HOW DO I SWITCH CHARACTERS IN FREEPLAY???"
Try SHIFT + LEFT or SHIFT + RIGHT. Why doesn't it loop when going to the left? Couldn't be fucked to do it.
