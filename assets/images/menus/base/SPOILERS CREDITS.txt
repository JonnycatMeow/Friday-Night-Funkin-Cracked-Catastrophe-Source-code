MOD NAME HERE:

Aurazona (that's right, this was a solo project!!!)

and now, lemme ramble for a bit.

This mod started out as a lil text file, believe it or not. it was one of my 'rainy day' mod ideas. I kinda threw it aside and forgot about it for a couple months while i tried to improve my skills in music and struggled with uni. I eventually remembered the file existed, and remembered that I wanted to make a buncha different one shot mods in different engines, so I decided to go with this concept. I got a track made, fucked around in animate, and spent /way/ too long on programming. It probably took about a day each for the music and the sprites to be made, but programming took a few weeks. I really tried to push both my boundaries, and the boundaries of funkin for some of this shit, so i'm real glad to see that you decided to pick up the mod and read through these credits <3.
