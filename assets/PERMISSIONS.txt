WHAT YOU CAN USE/DO (with credit, obviously):

the music, as long as it isn't for profit. Gameplay videos or background music is fine, but don't just upload the music and slap ads on there.

The sprites. Shouldn't really need to say this since they're all modified from base funkin anyways, but I'd prefer to cover as many bases as possible.

The code. I was initially gonna keep this whole thing closed off since a lot of programmers just like to yoink shit without credit, but then I had an epiphany to stop being such a little bitch. To any programmers, I'm sorry for what you're going to read.

WHAT YOU CAN'T USE/DO:

port this mod to psych. if you're gonna port the mod, at least put in some fucking effort. Note that this also overrides anything I said you could use in the above section.

WEIRD GREY AREA MIDDLE GROUND SHIT:

Roblox games. sure whatever, i don't care. make sure to credit me.
Except if it's funky friday. I don't want roblox tencent (read: gamefam) anywhere near my shit.


If you use any of this shit, credit 'God's Drunkest Driver'.
