Here's some general guidelines for screwing with the .txt files for raid mode:
I'd recommend you follow these, as otherwise the game'll most likely fucking die and that'll be on you. 
If you change something and it breaks shit, it isn't my problem.


raidPlayers.txt:
> THERE SHOULD BE 8 PLAYERS MINIMUM IN raidPlayers.txt
> SEPERATE STRINGS SHOULD BE SEPERATED BY A COMMA.

raidChat###.txt:
> SEPERATE STRINGS SHOULD BE SEPERATED BY A FORWARD SLASH /
> THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 1 LINE IN EACH FILE.
